#Here I modified the VGG16 architecture. Like this, you can modify any transfer learning architecture (ResNet50 , VGG19, MobileNet, InceptionResNetV2 etc...).

For better understand, here I mention one of my published articles where I work with the improved-VGG16 architecture. This study has developed a robust intelligent auditory sensation system utilizing a pre-train deep learning framework based on CWT & improved-VGG16 architecture. The proposed architecture has achieved state-of-art performance with a concise decision window.

Thank to all.
